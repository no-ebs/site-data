      <description>About CashQ CashQ is our upcoming mobile payment app. It heavily relies on QR for helping its users to do payments and many other features. It built on top of noebs, our free and open source payment gateway.
Problem statement We wanted to build a reliable system without repeating ourselves. Huge part of our time is being wasted (and it would be) on EBS and Central Bank of Sudan internal processes.</description>

      <description>In financial transactions, pin block calculations is one of the most important tasks and it&amp;rsquo;s often a source for mistakes. In this article, we will be discussing pin block calculations in EBS system (it uses DES) while using our implementation, TA. TA is written in Python and it is used internally by our team for all of our testing and pin calculations. The source code is also available in Github.</description>

      <description>API-first, high performant middleware. noebs is the most secure and modern middleware.
 What is noebs It is definitely not a replacement for EBS, if anything we embrace the use of EBS and its role as a unified switching system. But, we aim to provide a thin wrapper around EBS functionalities that can be exposed to both POS and mobile applications. A starting point where you can write your business logic.</description>

      <description>noebs supports interesting technologies that makes it the best in class solution. We support HTTP/2, server push (for live dashboard updates). It comes with Redis support and optional classical DB (you can use sqlite, mysql, and postgres). Resiliency and database distributions are first class citizen. When using proper setup, you can scale upto how your load balancer can handle. We use nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer, and using this awesome setup we were able to scale to multiple servers without changing a single line of code in noebs.</description>

      <title>Guides on how to deploy your noebs applications</title>
      <link>https://noebs.dev/guides/use-noebs/</link>

      <description>Why Go? Go is really fast! Our application can happily serve more than 60k req/sec. The bottleneck will never be on your payment gateway service! Plus, Go helps with many of the problems I faced while working with Python, the static typing can prevent your errors from occurring only at runtime, and your code will compile into a single binary that you just run. I’ve been very excited to write web services Go and this project offers me just that!</description>
